# Ub-QT

Ub-QT is a bipedal robot project designed to sense its environment and follow its master. This project combines ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) and AI to create an intelligent and responsive robot. The development of Ub-QT is part of a 90-day challenge to push the boundaries of robotics and AI.

## Project Goals
1. **Bipedal Locomotion**: Develop a stable and efficient walking mechanism for the robot.
2. **Environmental Sensing**: Integrate sensors to detect obstacles, track movement, and understand the surroundings.
3. **Master Following**: Implement AI algorithms to enable the robot to follow a designated person.
4. **ROS2 Integration**: Use ROS2 for communication and control of the robot's components.
5. **AI-Driven Behavior**: Leverage AI for decision-making and adaptability in dynamic environments.

## 90-Day Challenge Plan
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-30)**: Research and Planning
  - Define hardware and software requirements.
  - Design the robot's physical structure.
  - Set up the ROS2 environment and basic simulation.

- **Phase 2 (Days 31-60)**: Development
  - Build the robot's physical prototype.
  - Implement bipedal locomotion algorithms.
  - Integrate sensors and test environmental sensing.

- **Phase 3 (Days 61-90)**: AI and Testing
  - Develop AI algorithms for master following.
  - Test and refine the robot's behavior in real-world scenarios.
  - Document the project and prepare for deployment.

## Getting Started
To get started with Ub-QT, ensure you have the following:
- ROS2 installed on your system.
- Access to the required hardware components (e.g., sensors, actuators, microcontrollers).
- Familiarity with Python and C++ for ROS2 development.
